This repository contains R code that helps in finding the best hyperparameters for training neural networks (NN). It also includes tools to compare neural network models built using PyTorch and TensorFlow.

Features:
**1- Hyperparameter Optimization:** Implements a method to find the best hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of layers) for training neural networks, helping improve model accuracy and efficiency.
**2- PyTorch and TensorFlow Comparison:** Provides functionality to compare the performance of neural network models built using PyTorch and TensorFlow. The comparison focuses on key metrics such as accuracy, loss, and training time.
